## General notes

All relevant files for the execution are stored in the directory **./src**.  
The code is stored in Jupyter Notebook files and named after the task description.  
Created plots are stored in the respective directiory under ../plots.   
For easy execution we created a Conda environment (./environment.yml) including all necessary dependencies and packages.
